# COVID-19 F@H Azure VM Template
**Deploy an Azure VM to help Folding@Home**

This is an Azure VM template which deploys a GPU-enabled VM of your choice to help the
[Folding@Home](https://foldingathome.org/) project find ways to combat COVID-19. It is
expected that the default VM (`Standard_NC6_Promo`) will cost about $350 per month to run
(depending on your choice of region etc) which means that on the stock Azure trial benefit
you should be able to get about 2 weeks of runtime before running out of free credits.

Thank you to @nst and @lupino3 for their contributions to building this template.
